# Encryption
Encrypting and decrypting information using specific generated key in Java.
Using class Keygen, generated key will be created and saved in a key.txt. 
Class Encrypting will read a txt file: "info.txt" and transfer information character by character into array. 
Later class will create an alphabet array and compare input array with the alphabet, 
creating a new array with the position of each character of the input text in the alphabet. 
After that class will read a key.txt file and compare to arrays and encrypt information. 
Decryption class uses the same concept as encryption class. 

enjoy!
